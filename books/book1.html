  <h3>Chapter One</h3>
  <h4>Fresh Starts</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">Mukeh did not believe in fresh starts.</p>
<p>He believed in survival.</p>
<p>When he transferred at the beginning of the academic year, people treated it like opportunity — a clean slate, a reset button, a chance to become someone new.</p>
<p>But walking through the school gates that first morning didn’t feel new.</p>
<p>It felt heavy.</p>
<p>The courtyard was already alive — voices layered over each other, laughter breaking easily between groups who had known each other for years. Students leaned against walls with the comfort of familiarity. Others crossed the grounds like they belonged to every inch of it.</p>
<p>Mukeh adjusted the strap of his bag and walked forward.</p>
<p>He didn’t rush.</p>
<p>He didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>He observed.</p>
<p>He always observed first.</p>

<p>He noticed who controlled conversations.<br>
Who laughed the loudest.<br>
Who stayed quiet.<br>
Who moved with authority.<br>
Who moved with ease.</p>

<p>He had come with one quiet decision: rebuild himself academically. Not for applause. Not for competition.</p>
<p><strong>For control.</strong></p>

<p>Munu noticed him almost immediately.</p>
<p>“You look like you’re analyzing us,” Munu said, leaning back beneath the big tree at the center of the courtyard.</p>
<p>“I just got here,” Mukeh replied evenly.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Munu grinned. “And you’re already thinking.”</p>
<p>Lewis laughed nearby. “He does look serious.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a crime,” James Samba added quietly. “Give him a day.”</p>
<p>Munu shrugged. “Fine. One day. After that, you’re participating.”</p>
<p>Mukeh didn’t respond.</p>
<p>But he appreciated something about the interaction.</p>
<p>It wasn’t hostile.</p>
<p>It was testing.</p>
<p>And testing was familiar.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>He saw Francess later that week.</p>
<p>Not because someone introduced her.</p>
<p>Because the atmosphere shifted when she passed.</p>
<p>She wasn’t loud.</p>
<p>She wasn’t trying to be seen.</p>
<p>She didn’t command attention the way Munu did.</p>
<p>But attention followed her anyway.</p>
<p>She walked across the courtyard with measured steps, books held close, posture straight, expression composed.</p>
<p>Later he would learn she had topped her class consistently for years. No one had beaten her overall.</p>
<p>When someone managed to outscore her in a subject even briefly, she didn’t collapse.</p>
<p>She recalculated.</p>
<p>And reclaimed her place.</p>
<p>That wasn’t ego.</p>
<p>That was discipline.</p>
<p>Mukeh respected discipline.</p>
<p>He also felt something tighten inside him the first time he heard her answer a question in class.</p>
<p>Not jealousy.</p>
<p>Challenge.</p>
<p>He didn’t know her.</p>
<p>She didn’t know him.</p>
<p><strong>But awareness had begun.</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter Two</h3>
  <h4>Under the Tree</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">By the second week, Mukeh understood something important:</p>
<p>The group under the big tree wasn’t random.</p>
<p>It was a system.</p>

<p>Lewis brought energy that refused to settle.<br>
Amidu brought ideas no one asked for but everyone argued.<br>
Dukes brought precision.<br>
Valentina brought ease.<br>
Hawa brought perception.<br>
Diallo brought quiet steadiness.<br>
James brought balance.<br>
Munu brought movement.<br>
And Yillah brought charm — the kind that made even silence look intentional.</p>

<p>Mukeh brought observation.</p>
<p>He still didn’t feel fully woven into the rhythm, but he wasn’t outside it either. He listened more than he spoke. Measured before responding. Watched how people reacted to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Especially her.</strong></p>

<p>Francess didn’t try to lead conversations. She didn’t need to. When she spoke, it was direct and structured. No filler. No wandering.</p>
<p>She never tried to be the smartest in the room.</p>
<p>She simply was.</p>
<p>And that unsettled him more than arrogance ever could.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>“Okay,” Munu said one afternoon, clapping his hands lightly. “We need to talk about this exam.”</p>
<p>Lewis groaned. “Already?”</p>
<p>“Yes, already,” Munu replied. “Some of you are acting like confidence is a study plan.”</p>
<p>Yillah leaned back against the tree trunk. “Confidence is part of it.”</p>
<p>“That’s because you flirt with teachers,” Dukes said flatly.</p>
<p>Yillah smiled lazily. “I don’t flirt. I connect.”</p>
<p>Valentina laughed.</p>
<p>Diallo shook her head softly but stayed close to Munu, her arm brushing his briefly.</p>
<p>Mukeh listened.</p>
<p>“New guy,” Munu said, turning toward him. “What’s your plan?”</p>
<p>Mukeh hesitated for half a second.</p>
<p>Then answered simply.</p>
<p>“Study consistently. Break topics down. Practice questions last.”</p>
<p>Lewis frowned. “That sounds like effort.”</p>
<p>“It is,” Mukeh replied.</p>
<p>Dukes nodded once. “That’s reasonable.”</p>
<p>Amidu leaned forward. “But effort doesn’t guarantee outcome.”</p>
<p>“No,” Mukeh said calmly. “But lack of effort guarantees failure.”</p>
<p>There was a brief pause.</p>
<p>Yillah tilted his head slightly, amused. “He talks like someone who’s been losing.”</p>
<p>Mukeh met his gaze evenly. “Or someone who doesn’t plan to.”</p>
<p>That earned a small reaction from Lewis.</p>
<p>Not loud approval.</p>
<p>Respect.</p>

<p>Across from them, Francess closed her notebook slowly.</p>
<p>“You’re over-structuring it,” she said.</p>
<p>Mukeh turned toward her. “Preparation is structure.”</p>
<p>“Structure without flexibility fails.”</p>
<p>Their eyes locked.</p>
<p>Not warm.</p>
<p>Not hostile.</p>
<p>Measured.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a debate yet.</p>
<p>It was a calibration.</p>

<p>Hawa watched closely.</p>
<p>Then she said it.</p>
<p>“Oh please. Everyone knows he’s working this hard because of Francess.”</p>

<p>The air changed.</p>
<p>Lewis froze mid-smirk.</p>
<p>Diallo’s eyes flicked toward Francess.</p>
<p>James looked at Mukeh immediately.</p>
<p>Munu didn’t laugh this time.</p>
<p>Yillah raised an eyebrow — not defensive, not tense — just entertained.</p>

<p>“That’s not—” Mukeh began.</p>
<p>“It’s not what?” Hawa asked softly.</p>
<p>She wasn’t teasing.</p>
<p>She was observing aloud.</p>

<p>Mukeh felt something tighten in his chest.</p>
<p>Was he working harder because Francess existed?</p>
<p>Not to impress her.</p>
<p>But because she was the standard.</p>
<p>And he refused to stand beneath a standard.</p>

<p>Francess spoke calmly.</p>
<p>“If someone chooses to work hard, that’s their decision.”</p>
<p>Neutral.</p>
<p>Composed.</p>
<p>But distant.</p>

<p>That distance mattered.</p>
<p>Mukeh held her gaze for a fraction too long.</p>
<p>There was no softness there.</p>
<p>No denial.</p>
<p>Just awareness.</p>
<p>Challenge.</p>

<p>Yillah broke the tension casually.</p>
<p>“So what I’m hearing,” he said lightly, “is we should all start working harder.”</p>
<p>Lewis groaned. “Not you too.”</p>
<p>Valentina laughed, and the moment loosened slightly.</p>
<p>Conversation resumed.</p>
<p>But something had shifted.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>As the group began to disperse, Yillah fell into step beside Mukeh.</p>
<p>Not confrontational.</p>
<p>Not protective.</p>
<p>Just smooth.</p>
<p>“You competitive?” Yillah asked casually.</p>
<p>“With myself,” Mukeh replied.</p>
<p>Yillah smiled faintly. “Good answer.”</p>
<p>A beat passed.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>“Just don’t let people narrate your story for you.”</p>
<p>Mukeh glanced at him.</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
<p>Yillah nodded once and drifted back toward the others, already mid-conversation with Valentina about something unrelated.</p>

<p>Diallo called Munu’s name softly.</p>
<p>He turned immediately, expression easing without effort.</p>
<p>They walked off together — not loudly, not dramatically — just naturally aligned.</p>

<p>James lingered behind for a moment.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to prove anything,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>Mukeh didn’t respond right away.</p>
<p>“I know,” he said finally.</p>
<p>But he wasn’t sure that was true.</p>

<p>Across the courtyard, Francess packed her things with controlled movements.</p>
<p>Hawa leaned slightly toward her.</p>
<p>“You don’t like that he’s trying to match you,” Hawa said.</p>
<p>Francess didn’t look up.</p>
<p>“I don’t like being someone’s reason.”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t look like he’s chasing.”</p>
<p>“No,” Francess agreed softly. “He looks like he’s measuring.”</p>

<p>That unsettled her more.</p>
<p>Because being measured meant being seen.</p>
<p>And being seen meant vulnerability.</p>
<p>She didn’t do vulnerability.</p>
<p>Not publicly.</p>

<p>That evening, Mukeh studied again.</p>
<p>Not angrily.</p>
<p>Not obsessively.</p>
<p>Intentionally.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to beat Francess.</p>
<p>He wanted to stand beside her.</p>
<p>And that required strength.</p>

<p>Across town, Francess reviewed her notes.</p>
<p>Not thinking about him.</p>
<p>But aware of him.</p>
<p>And awareness is where everything begins.</p>

  <h3>Chapter Three</h3>
  <h4>Calibration</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">The tension from under the tree didn’t dissolve.</p>
<p>It adjusted.</p>

<p>By midweek, the group found themselves near the basketball court again. It wasn’t planned. It rarely was. Lewis brought the ball. Munu brought commentary. Yillah brought smooth distractions. Valentina brought movement in and out of conversations like she was conducting something invisible.</p>

<p>Diallo stood near Munu, quieter in the open space, her presence noticeable mostly by proximity. She wasn’t loud enough to dominate, but not withdrawn enough to disappear.</p>

<p>James leaned against the fence, watching without intruding.</p>

<p>Mukeh stood inside the circle this time.</p>
<p>Not fully merged.</p>
<p>But not outside either.</p>

<p>Lewis spun the ball once in his hand.</p>
<p>“New guy,” he said. “Let’s see if intelligence translates.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t mocking.</p>
<p>It was invitation.</p>

<p>Munu added, “You’ve been talking discipline all week. Show balance.”</p>

<p>Mukeh didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>He stepped onto the court.</p>
<p>The first shot missed.</p>
<p>Lewis raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>The second attempt hit the rim.</p>
<p>Munu didn’t laugh. He just folded his arms, watching.</p>
<p>The third went in clean.</p>
<p>Lewis nodded once. “Adjustment.”</p>
<p>That word mattered.</p>

<p>Mukeh didn’t smile.</p>
<p>He didn’t celebrate.</p>
<p>He stepped back into the group like it was expected.</p>

<p>Across from him, Francess watched.</p>
<p>Not impressed.</p>
<p>Not dismissive.</p>
<p>Just observing.</p>
<p>That observation felt heavier than approval.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>The game lost intensity after a while. Conversations reformed naturally.</p>
<p>Amidu restarted a philosophical argument.<br>
Dukes dismantled it calmly.<br>
Valentina laughed at something Yillah said.<br>
Munu engaged three people at once without trying.</p>

<p>Mukeh felt it — the rhythm of belonging beginning to take shape.</p>
<p>Not because he was loud.</p>
<p>But because he wasn’t invisible.</p>

<p>He caught Francess’ eye once.</p>
<p>It wasn’t accidental.</p>
<p>It wasn’t intentional either.</p>
<p>Just awareness.</p>

<p>He walked toward her.</p>
<p>Not fast.</p>
<p>Not hesitant.</p>
<p>Measured.</p>

<p>“Are you staying?” he asked.</p>
<p>“For what?” she replied evenly.</p>
<p>“Study session.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need supervision.”</p>
<p>“I’m not asking for supervision.”</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
<p>“Then what are you asking for?”</p>

<p>There were multiple correct answers.</p>
<p>He chose none of them.</p>

<p>“Company.”</p>

<p>The word didn’t land softly.</p>
<p>It didn’t land strategically.</p>
<p>It just sat there.</p>
<p>Unlabeled.</p>

<p>Hawa noticed the exchange immediately.</p>
<p>Yillah glanced over briefly but didn’t interfere.</p>
<p>James shifted slightly, attentive but not intrusive.</p>

<p>Francess held Mukeh’s gaze.</p>
<p>There was no warmth in it.</p>
<p>No irritation either.</p>
<p>She was reading him.</p>
<p>And he was letting her.</p>

<p>“I have an hour,” she said finally.</p>
<p>It wasn’t agreement.</p>
<p>It wasn’t refusal.</p>
<p>It was controlled allowance.</p>

<p>Mukeh nodded once.</p>
<p>Nothing more.</p>

<p>They walked toward the library steps with space between them — not close enough to suggest anything, not far enough to deny awareness.</p>

<p>Behind them, Munu watched for half a second before turning back to Lewis.</p>
<p>“See?” he said lightly. “Inclusion.”</p>

<p>Diallo tapped his arm softly.</p>
<p>“Let them breathe,” she murmured.</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>“Always.”</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>On the library steps, the air felt different.</p>
<p>Quieter.</p>
<p>Less performative.</p>

<p>They sat with deliberate distance.</p>
<p>Books opened.</p>
<p>Pens moved.</p>
<p>Silence stretched.</p>

<p>“You skipped a step,” Francess said after a few minutes.</p>
<p>“I condensed it.”</p>
<p>“You assumed understanding.”</p>
<p>“I trusted logic.”</p>

<p>She looked at him.</p>
<p>“That’s not the same thing.”</p>

<p>“And over-explaining isn’t strength.”</p>

<p>The exchange wasn’t heated.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t relaxed either.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to compete with me,” she said calmly.</p>
<p>“I’m not competing.”</p>
<p>“You are.”</p>
<p>“And what are you doing?”</p>

<p>That pause again.</p>
<p>Measured.</p>

<p>She didn’t answer immediately.</p>

<p>“When you’re the one who doesn’t slip,” she said quietly, “you don’t get the luxury of uncertainty.”</p>

<p>He studied her expression.</p>
<p>It wasn’t vulnerability.</p>
<p>It was control under pressure.</p>

<p>“For you, correcting might feel like pride,” she continued. “For me, it’s survival.”</p>

<p>The word hung heavier than expected.</p>

<p>Neither softened.</p>
<p>Neither retreated.</p>

<p>But something shifted.</p>
<p>Not into closeness.</p>
<p>Into recognition.</p>

<p>After a moment, she closed her notebook.</p>
<p>“We still have twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>And they returned to work.</p>
<p>Ambiguous.</p>
<p>Unreadable.</p>
<p>Unresolved.</p>


<section class="chapter-title">
  <h3>Chapter Four</h3>
  <h4>Surface Tension</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">The days after the library steps felt normal.</p>
<p>Too normal.</p>

<p>The group gathered again beneath the tree as if nothing had shifted. That was the way of things — tension rarely interrupted routine unless someone forced it to.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Lewis was mid-argument about rankings again.</p>

<p>“I’m telling you, this year will be different,” he said. “I’m not settling for average.”</p>

<p>Dukes raised an eyebrow. “You say that every year.”</p>

<p>“And every year I improve.”</p>

<p>“Incrementally,” she replied calmly.</p>

<p>Yillah laughed lightly. “Improvement is improvement.”</p>

<p>Valentina tilted her head toward him. “You’re defending him?”</p>

<p>“I defend potential,” Yillah said smoothly.</p>

<p>Munu leaned back against the tree trunk. “Potential doesn’t write exams.”</p>

<p>Diallo nudged his arm gently. “Neither does talking.”</p>

<p>Munu grinned. “That’s why I surround myself with intelligent people.”</p>

<p>He glanced briefly toward Mukeh.</p>
<p>Not obvious.</p>
<p>Inclusive.</p>

<p>Mukeh felt it — the subtle pull inward.</p>

<p>He wasn’t being tested anymore.</p>
<p>He was being absorbed.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Across the circle, Francess sat with Hawa. She wasn’t withdrawn, but she wasn’t leaning in either. She contributed when necessary. Corrected when needed. Listened more than she spoke.</p>

<p>Mukeh answered a question Dukes posed about a past exam paper.</p>

<p>Francess followed with a refinement.</p>

<p>Their responses didn’t clash.</p>
<p>But they didn’t align either.</p>

<p>It wasn’t hostility.</p>
<p>It was calibration.</p>

<p>Hawa watched them both.</p>

<p>And then it began.</p>

<p>Not loudly.</p>
<p>Not dramatically.</p>

<p>Just a sentence dropped into the air.</p>

<p>“I heard something,” Valentina said lightly.</p>

<p>Lewis leaned forward. “That’s dangerous.”</p>

<p>Valentina smiled faintly. “Apparently, Mukeh’s been asking about Clarisse.”</p>

<p>The group shifted.</p>
<p>Not violently.</p>
<p>But noticeably.</p>

<p>Mukeh’s jaw tightened slightly.</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” he said calmly.</p>

<p>Yillah raised an eyebrow. “Clarisse?”</p>

<p>Munu didn’t laugh this time.</p>

<p>Diallo glanced at Mukeh quietly.</p>

<p>Francess didn’t look up immediately.</p>

<p>That was worse.</p>

<p>Valentina shrugged. “That’s what people are saying.”</p>

<p>Mukeh’s voice remained steady. “People are wrong.”</p>

<p>Hawa studied him.</p>

<p>“Who started it?” James asked.</p>

<p>“No idea,” Valentina replied.</p>

<p>Francess finally spoke.</p>

<p>“I don’t respond to rumors.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t anger.</p>
<p>It wasn’t jealousy.</p>

<p>It was distance.</p>
<p>Controlled.</p>

<p>And Mukeh felt that distance.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Clarisse passed nearby at that exact moment, laughing at something someone else said. Confident. Polished. Untouched by whatever narrative was forming.</p>

<p>Munu exhaled slowly.</p>

<p>“School gets bored,” he said. “Don’t feed it.”</p>

<p>Yillah nodded once. “Facts.”</p>

<p>The group conversation shifted gradually.</p>

<p>But the air remained altered.</p>

<p>Mukeh didn’t like being narrated.</p>

<p>He liked control.</p>

<p>And this wasn’t control.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Later that afternoon, the group thinned out.</p>

<p>Lewis left first.</p>

<p>Dukes followed.</p>

<p>Valentina drifted toward another conversation.</p>

<p>James walked off quietly.</p>

<p>Yillah lingered briefly before heading toward the parking area, already mid-laugh with someone else.</p>

<p>Munu stayed.</p>
<p>Diallo stayed.</p>

<p>They stood near the edge of the court where shadows stretched longer.</p>

<p>“You didn’t like that,” Diallo said softly.</p>

<p>Munu looked toward where Mukeh had walked off earlier.</p>

<p>“He’ll handle it.”</p>

<p>“That’s not what I meant.”</p>

<p>Munu glanced at her.</p>

<p>“You mean the rumor?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“It’s unnecessary.”</p>

<p>Munu exhaled.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look like someone who tolerates unnecessary things.”</p>

<p>Diallo was quiet for a moment.</p>

<p>Then, softer:</p>

<p>“Neither does she.”</p>

<p>That made Munu pause.</p>

<p>He stepped closer to Diallo.</p>

<p>Not loud.</p>
<p>Not theatrical.</p>

<p>Just near.</p>

<p>“You think it bothers her?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I think she doesn’t like being part of a story she didn’t write.”</p>

<p>Munu smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“You’re smarter than you act.”</p>

<p>Diallo rolled her eyes slightly.</p>

<p>“I don’t act.”</p>

<p>He brushed his thumb lightly along her wrist.</p>

<p>She didn’t pull away.</p>

<p>“You staying tomorrow?” he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>He leaned in and kissed her.</p>

<p>Not dramatic.</p>
<p>Not rushed.</p>

<p>Familiar.</p>

<p>She responded gently — shy in public, but certain.</p>

<p>When they pulled apart, she rested her forehead briefly against his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don’t let things escalate,” she murmured.</p>

<p>Munu’s expression shifted — less playful now.</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Elsewhere, Mukeh walked alone for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Not angry.</p>
<p>Not embarrassed.</p>

<p>But unsettled.</p>

<p>He didn’t care about Clarisse.</p>

<p>He disliked being misrepresented.</p>

<p>More than that —</p>

<p>He disliked the possibility that Francess might believe it.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Across campus, Francess closed her notebook deliberately.</p>

<p>Hawa glanced at her.</p>

<p>“You believe it?”</p>

<p>Francess shook her head.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But?”</p>

<p>Francess exhaled slowly.</p>

<p>“I don’t like distractions.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t jealousy.</p>

<p>It was disruption.</p>

<p>And disruption, she avoided.</p>

  <h3>Chapter Five</h3>
  <h4>Lines</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">Mukeh didn’t wait.</p>
<p>He didn’t explode either.</p>
<p>He simply decided.</p>

<p>By mid-morning the next day, he knew who had started it.</p>

<p>Selina.</p>

<p>Not close to Clarisse. Not close to the group either. But socially loud enough that things she said carried.</p>

<p>He found her near the staircase between classes.</p>

<p>She was mid-laughter when he approached.</p>

<p>Her smile faded slightly when she noticed his expression.</p>

<p>“You’ve been saying I asked about Clarisse,” Mukeh said calmly.</p>

<p>No greeting.</p>
<p>No preamble.</p>

<p>Selina blinked. “I didn’t say you asked.”</p>

<p>“What did you say?”</p>

<p>“That you were… interested.”</p>

<p>“I’m not.”</p>

<p>She shrugged lightly. “It’s not that serious.”</p>

<p>“It is to me.”</p>

<p>A few students slowed nearby. Not close enough to interrupt. Close enough to listen.</p>

<p>Selina crossed her arms. “Why do you care so much?”</p>

<p>Mukeh held her gaze.</p>

<p>Because reputation matters.<br>
Because control matters.<br>
Because I don’t tolerate being narrated.</p>

<p>But he didn’t say all of that.</p>

<p>“You don’t attach my name to something false,” he said evenly. “And call it casual.”</p>

<p>She laughed nervously. “People talk.”</p>

<p>“Then correct it.”</p>

<p>“Or what?”</p>

<p>A beat.</p>

<p>“Or I escalate it.”</p>

<p>She scoffed. “You’re dramatic.”</p>

<p>“No,” he said calmly. “I’m direct.”</p>

<p>Silence stretched.</p>

<p>She hadn’t expected that.</p>

<p>“You’re overreacting,” she said.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied. “You’re minimizing.”</p>

<p>Another pause.</p>

<p>He stepped back slightly.</p>

<p>“You’ll correct it,” he said. “Today.”</p>

<p>And then he walked away.</p>

<p>Not heated.</p>
<p>Not shouting.</p>

<p>Controlled.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>He didn’t stop there.</p>

<p>He reported it.</p>

<p>Not emotionally.</p>
<p>Not angrily.</p>

<p>Formally.</p>

<p>By afternoon, Selina had been called in.</p>

<p>By the next morning, the rumor had slowed almost completely.</p>

<p>But something else had spread.</p>

<p>Mukeh went to administration.</p>

<p>That carried weight.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>The group knew before he said anything.</p>

<p>Lewis leaned back against the tree. “You really did that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mukeh replied.</p>

<p>Munu didn’t smile.</p>

<p>“You move fast,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t sit on things.”</p>

<p>Yillah tilted his head slightly, studying him.</p>

<p>“Respect,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>James didn’t react immediately.</p>

<p>“Did you talk to her first?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I handled it.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t the question.”</p>

<p>Mukeh didn’t answer.</p>

<p>Across from him, Francess sat with composed stillness.</p>

<p>Hawa watched her.</p>

<p>Finally, Francess spoke.</p>

<p>“You escalated it.”</p>

<p>“It was false,” Mukeh replied.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t mean it required administration.”</p>

<p>He met her gaze.</p>

<p>“It required correction.”</p>

<p>“For you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>“And for you,” he added.</p>

<p>Her eyes sharpened slightly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask you to protect me.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t protecting you.”</p>

<p>“Then what were you doing?”</p>

<p>The answer came quickly.</p>

<p>“Protecting my name.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>That was the truth.</p>

<p>And the truth unsettled more than excuses would have.</p>

<p>Francess closed her notebook slowly.</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought,” she said.</p>

<p>Not angry.</p>
<p>Not soft.</p>

<p>Just measured.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>After the group dispersed, Yillah fell into step beside Mukeh briefly.</p>

<p>“You don’t like losing control,” Yillah said casually.</p>

<p>Mukeh glanced at him. “No.”</p>

<p>Yillah nodded.</p>

<p>“Just make sure control doesn’t become image.”</p>

<p>Mukeh didn’t respond.</p>

<p>But he heard it.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Later that evening, Munu and Diallo stood near the court again.</p>

<p>“You think he overdid it?” Diallo asked softly.</p>

<p>Munu exhaled slowly.</p>

<p>“He’s not wrong.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t my question.”</p>

<p>Munu looked toward the main building.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t tolerate noise.”</p>

<p>“And she doesn’t like force,” Diallo replied.</p>

<p>That made Munu pause.</p>

<p>He stepped closer to her.</p>

<p>“You always see the angle.”</p>

<p>“I just see both sides.”</p>

<p>He kissed her — softer this time.</p>

<p>Less playful.</p>
<p>More grounding.</p>

<p>When they pulled apart, he rested his forehead briefly against hers.</p>

<p>“Things are shifting,” Diallo murmured.</p>

<p>Munu nodded.</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Elsewhere, Francess sat alone at her desk.</p>

<p>She didn’t think Mukeh was wrong.</p>

<p>She didn’t think he was right either.</p>

<p>She thought he was intense.</p>

<p>And intensity, when mismanaged, can burn.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Across town, Mukeh lay awake longer than he expected.</p>

<p>He had corrected the narrative.</p>

<p>But something else had shifted.</p>

<p>Not the rumor.</p>

<p>The balance.</p>

<hr class="ornament"/>

<section class="chapter-title">
  <h3>Chapter Six</h3>
  <h4>Aftermath</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">The rumor died.</p>
<p>But silence replaced it.</p>

<p>Not the comfortable kind.</p>
<p>The evaluative kind.</p>

<p>By Thursday, the courtyard felt the same on the surface — Lewis arguing, Munu talking, Valentina laughing, Yillah drifting between conversations like he owned none of them but belonged to all.</p>

<p>But something underneath had shifted.</p>

<p>People were more careful around Mukeh.</p>

<p>Not distant.</p>
<p>Careful.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Lewis approached first.</p>

<p>“You really reported her,” he said, not accusing — confirming.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Lewis nodded slowly. “That’s… decisive.”</p>

<p>“It was necessary.”</p>

<p>Lewis studied him a moment longer than usual.</p>

<p>Then shrugged. “Fair.”</p>

<p>He wasn’t fully convinced.</p>

<p>But he respected strength.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Munu handled it differently.</p>

<p>He didn’t bring it up immediately.</p>

<p>Instead, he pulled Mukeh into conversation more than usual.</p>

<p>“What do you think about the test format?”<br>
“Would you approach it differently?”<br>
“You’re good with structure — help Lewis not fail.”</p>

<p>Inclusive.</p>
<p>Intentional.</p>

<p>He wasn’t defending him publicly.</p>
<p>He was reinforcing him socially.</p>

<p>Diallo noticed.</p>
<p>She always noticed.</p>

<p>When Munu leaned in close to Mukeh during conversation, lowering his voice so others couldn’t hear, it wasn’t about secrets.</p>

<p>It was about alignment.</p>

<p>“You don’t like noise,” Munu said quietly.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Just make sure silence doesn’t turn into isolation.”</p>

<p>Mukeh didn’t answer.</p>

<p>But he heard it.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Francess handled it with distance.</p>

<p>Not coldness.</p>
<p>Distance.</p>

<p>When he spoke in class, she didn’t correct him unnecessarily.</p>

<p>But she didn’t engage beyond what was required either.</p>

<p>Measured.</p>
<p>Controlled.</p>
<p>Unreachable.</p>

<p>Hawa saw it immediately.</p>

<p>“You’re pulling back,” Hawa said quietly as they walked toward the library steps.</p>

<p>“I’m stabilizing,” Francess replied.</p>

<p>“He didn’t lie.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say he did.”</p>

<p>“Then what’s the issue?”</p>

<p>Francess stopped walking for a moment.</p>

<p>“He escalates.”</p>

<p>Hawa waited.</p>

<p>“And escalation creates attention.”</p>

<p>“And?”</p>

<p>Francess exhaled slowly.</p>

<p>“I don’t like attention.”</p>

<p>Not the kind that attaches names.</p>
<p>Not the kind that turns dynamics into spectacle.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>That afternoon, the group gathered again.</p>

<p>Yillah was mid-story, describing some interaction that made Valentina laugh.</p>

<p>James listened carefully, always slightly outside the center but never absent.</p>

<p>Dukes debated Amidu with surgical calm.</p>

<p>Lewis bounced the ball lazily.</p>

<p>Mukeh sat inside the circle.</p>

<p>But he felt the weight of awareness.</p>

<p>He caught Francess looking at him once.</p>

<p>It wasn’t soft.</p>
<p>It wasn’t angry.</p>

<p>It was studying.</p>

<p>He held the gaze.</p>

<p>She didn’t look away immediately.</p>

<p>That was new.</p>

<p>Then Yillah’s voice cut through casually.</p>

<p>“You two planning a silent war or what?”</p>

<p>Lewis laughed.</p>

<p>Valentina smirked.</p>

<p>Hawa didn’t.</p>

<p>Francess blinked once, then looked at Yillah.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Mukeh answered at the same time.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The timing was almost synchronized.</p>

<p>That unsettled more than disagreement would have.</p>

<p>Yillah leaned back, satisfied.</p>

<p>“Good,” he said lightly. “War ruins aesthetics.”</p>

<p>The group laughed.</p>

<p>But the moment lingered.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Later that evening, Mukeh found himself replaying something Francess had said in Chapter Five.</p>

<p>“You escalated it.”</p>

<p>He hadn’t been wrong.</p>

<p>But he had been intense.</p>

<p>And intensity, unmanaged, can corner people.</p>

<p>He wasn’t used to being questioned on method.</p>

<p>Only outcome.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Across town, Francess sat at her desk, staring at an open notebook she wasn’t reading.</p>

<p>He hadn’t lied.</p>
<p>He hadn’t exaggerated.</p>
<p>He had corrected a false narrative.</p>

<p>So why did it unsettle her?</p>

<p>Because he moved fast.</p>
<p>Because he didn’t consult.</p>
<p>Because he didn’t hesitate.</p>

<p>And hesitation is where she felt safe.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>The next day, something subtle happened.</p>

<p>The teacher asked a complex question.</p>

<p>Mukeh raised his hand.</p>

<p>Francess raised hers too.</p>

<p>The teacher called on Mukeh first.</p>

<p>He answered.</p>

<p>Precise.</p>
<p>Structured.</p>
<p>Confident.</p>

<p>Then the teacher turned to Francess.</p>

<p>She refined it.</p>

<p>Not corrected.</p>

<p>Refined.</p>

<p>The class murmured lightly.</p>

<p>Not competition.</p>

<p>Coordination.</p>

<p>For the first time, it didn’t feel like one trying to outdo the other.</p>

<p>It felt like something else.</p>

<p>Balance.</p>

<p>And balance is fragile.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>As the bell rang, Mukeh gathered his books.</p>

<p>Francess stood beside him briefly.</p>

<p>Not close.</p>
<p>Not distant.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to prove things every time,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>He looked at her.</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>She held his gaze.</p>

<p>“Sometimes you do.”</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>“And sometimes,” he replied, “you don’t let anyone see uncertainty.”</p>

<p>That landed.</p>

<p>Not harsh.</p>

<p>True.</p>

<p>She didn’t respond immediately.</p>

<p>Then:</p>

<p>“We’re not competing.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>Another pause.</p>

<p>“But we’re not neutral either,” she said.</p>

<p>He didn’t answer that.</p>

<p>Because she was right.</p>

<p>And neither of them had decided what that meant yet.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>Across the courtyard, Munu watched them from a distance.</p>

<p>Diallo stood beside him.</p>

<p>“They’re not fighting,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“They’re adjusting.”</p>

<p>Munu nodded.</p>

<p>“Adjustment decides everything.”</p>
