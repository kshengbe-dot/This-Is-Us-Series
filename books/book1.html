  <h3>Chapter One</h3>
  <h4>Fresh Starts</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">Mukeh did not believe in fresh starts.</p>

<p>He believed in survival.</p>

<p>When he transferred at the beginning of the academic year, people treated it like opportunity — a clean slate, a reset button, a chance to become someone new.</p>

<p>But walking through the school gates that first morning didn’t feel new.</p>

<p>It felt heavy.</p>

<p>The courtyard was already alive — voices layered over each other, laughter breaking easily between groups who had known each other for years. Students leaned against walls with the comfort of familiarity. Others crossed the grounds like they belonged to every inch of it.</p>

<p>Mukeh adjusted the strap of his bag and walked forward.</p>

<p>He didn’t rush.</p>
<p>He didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>He observed.</p>

<p>He always observed first.</p>

<p>He noticed who controlled conversations.  
Who laughed the loudest.  
Who stayed quiet.  
Who moved with authority.  
Who moved with ease.</p>

<p>He had come with one quiet decision: rebuild himself academically. Not for applause. Not for competition.</p>

<p><strong>For control.</strong></p>

<p>Munu noticed him almost immediately.</p>

<p>“You look like you’re analyzing us,” Munu said, leaning back beneath the big tree at the center of the courtyard.</p>

<p>“I just got here,” Mukeh replied evenly.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” Munu grinned. “And you’re already thinking.”</p>

<p>Lewis laughed nearby. “He does look serious.”</p>

<p>“That’s not a crime,” James Samba added quietly. “Give him a day.”</p>

<p>Munu shrugged. “Fine. One day. After that, you’re participating.”</p>

<p>Mukeh didn’t respond.</p>

<p>But he appreciated something about the interaction.</p>

<p>It wasn’t hostile.</p>
<p>It was testing.</p>

<p>And testing was familiar.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>He saw Francess later that week.</p>

<p>Not because someone introduced her.</p>

<p>Because the atmosphere shifted when she passed.</p>

<p>She wasn’t loud.</p>
<p>She wasn’t trying to be seen.</p>
<p>She didn’t command attention the way Munu did.</p>

<p>But attention followed her anyway.</p>

<p>She walked across the courtyard with measured steps, books held close, posture straight, expression composed.</p>

<p>Later he would learn she had topped her class consistently for years. No one had beaten her overall.</p>

<p>When someone managed to outscore her in a subject even briefly, she didn’t collapse.</p>

<p>She recalculated.</p>
<p>And reclaimed her place.</p>

<p>That wasn’t ego.</p>
<p>That was discipline.</p>

<p>Mukeh respected discipline.</p>

<p>He also felt something tighten inside him the first time he heard her answer a question in class.</p>

<p>Not jealousy.</p>
<p>Challenge.</p>

<p>He didn’t know her.</p>
<p>She didn’t know him.</p>

<p><strong>But awareness had begun.</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter Two</h3>
  <h4>Under the Tree</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">By the second week, Mukeh understood something important:</p>

<p>The group under the big tree wasn’t random.</p>

<p>It was a system.</p>

<p>Lewis brought energy that refused to settle.  
Amidu brought ideas no one asked for but everyone argued.  
Dukes brought precision.  
Valentina brought ease.  
Hawa brought perception.  
Diallo brought quiet steadiness.  
James brought balance.  
Munu brought movement.  
And Yillah brought charm — the kind that made even silence look intentional.</p>

<p>Mukeh brought observation.</p>

<p>He still didn’t feel fully woven into the rhythm, but he wasn’t outside it either. He listened more than he spoke. Measured before responding. Watched how people reacted to each other.</p>

<p><strong>Especially her.</strong></p>

<p>Francess didn’t try to lead conversations. She didn’t need to. When she spoke, it was direct and structured. No filler. No wandering.</p>

<p>She never tried to be the smartest in the room.</p>

<p>She simply was.</p>

<p>And that unsettled him more than arrogance ever could.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>“Okay,” Munu said one afternoon, clapping his hands lightly. “We need to talk about this exam.”</p>

<p>Lewis groaned. “Already?”</p>

<p>“Yes, already,” Munu replied. “Some of you are acting like confidence is a study plan.”</p>

<p>Yillah leaned back against the tree trunk. “Confidence is part of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you flirt with teachers,” Dukes said flatly.</p>

<p>Yillah smiled lazily. “I don’t flirt. I connect.”</p>

<p>Valentina laughed.</p>

<p>Diallo shook her head softly but stayed close to Munu, her arm brushing his briefly.</p>

<p>Mukeh listened.</p>

<p>“New guy,” Munu said, turning toward him. “What’s your plan?”</p>

<p>Mukeh hesitated for half a second.</p>

<p>Then answered simply.</p>

<p>“Study consistently. Break topics down. Practice questions last.”</p>

<p>Lewis frowned. “That sounds like effort.”</p>

<p>“It is,” Mukeh replied.</p>

<p>Dukes nodded once. “That’s reasonable.”</p>

<p>Amidu leaned forward. “But effort doesn’t guarantee outcome.”</p>

<p>“No,” Mukeh said calmly. “But lack of effort guarantees failure.”</p>

<p>There was a brief pause.</p>

<p>Yillah tilted his head slightly, amused. “He talks like someone who’s been losing.”</p>

<p>Mukeh met his gaze evenly. “Or someone who doesn’t plan to.”</p>

<p>Across from them, Francess closed her notebook slowly.</p>

<p>“You’re over-structuring it,” she said.</p>

<p>Mukeh turned toward her. “Preparation is structure.”</p>

<p>“Structure without flexibility fails.”</p>

<p>Their eyes locked.</p>

<p>Not warm.  
Not hostile.  
Measured.</p>

<p>Hawa watched closely.</p>

<p>Then she said it.</p>

<p>“Oh please. Everyone knows he’s working this hard because of Francess.”</p>

<p>The air changed.</p>

<p>Silence tightened.</p>

<p>Francess finally spoke.</p>

<p>“If someone chooses to work hard, that’s their decision.”</p>

<p>Neutral.  
Composed.  
But distant.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge had replaced invisibility.</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter Three</h3>
  <h4>Calibration</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">The tension from under the tree didn’t dissolve.</p>

<p>It adjusted.</p>

<p>By midweek, the group found themselves near the basketball court again. It wasn’t planned. It rarely was.</p>

<p>Lewis brought the ball.  
Munu brought commentary.  
Yillah brought smooth distractions.  
Valentina brought movement in and out of conversations like she was conducting something invisible.</p>

<p>Diallo stood near Munu, quieter in the open space, her presence noticeable mostly by proximity.</p>

<p>James leaned against the fence, watching without intruding.</p>

<p>Mukeh stood inside the circle this time.</p>

<p>Not fully merged.</p>
<p>But not outside either.</p>

<p>Lewis spun the ball once in his hand.</p>

<p>“New guy,” he said. “Let’s see if intelligence translates.”</p>

<p>Mukeh didn’t hesitate.</p>

<p>He stepped onto the court.</p>

<p>The first shot missed.</p>

<p>The second attempt hit the rim.</p>

<p>The third went in clean.</p>

<p>Lewis nodded once. “Adjustment.”</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>After the game, Mukeh approached Francess.</p>

<p>“Are you staying?”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“Study session.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need supervision.”</p>

<p>“I’m not asking for supervision.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you asking for?”</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>“Company.”</p>

<p>It didn’t sound romantic.</p>
<p>It didn’t sound strategic.</p>

<p>It just sat there.</p>

<p>Unlabeled.</p>

<p>“I have an hour,” she said.</p>

<p>Nothing more.</p>

<p>They walked toward the library steps — not close, not distant.</p>

<p><strong>Calibrating.</strong></p>
