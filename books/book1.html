  <h3>Chapter One</h3>
  <h4>Fresh Starts</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">Mukeh did not believe in fresh starts.</p>
<p>He believed in survival.</p>
<p>When he transferred at the beginning of the academic year, people treated it like opportunity — a clean slate, a reset button, a chance to become someone new.</p>
<p>But walking through the school gates that first morning didn’t feel new.</p>
<p>It felt heavy.</p>
<p>The courtyard was already alive — voices layered over each other, laughter breaking easily between groups who had known each other for years. Students leaned against walls with the comfort of familiarity. Others crossed the grounds like they belonged to every inch of it.</p>
<p>Mukeh adjusted the strap of his bag and walked forward.</p>
<p>He didn’t rush.</p>
<p>He didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>He observed.</p>
<p>He always observed first.</p>

<p>He noticed who controlled conversations.<br>
Who laughed the loudest.<br>
Who stayed quiet.<br>
Who moved with authority.<br>
Who moved with ease.</p>

<p>He had come with one quiet decision: rebuild himself academically. Not for applause. Not for competition.</p>
<p><strong>For control.</strong></p>

<p>Munu noticed him almost immediately.</p>
<p>“You look like you’re analyzing us,” Munu said, leaning back beneath the big tree at the center of the courtyard.</p>
<p>“I just got here,” Mukeh replied evenly.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Munu grinned. “And you’re already thinking.”</p>
<p>Lewis laughed nearby. “He does look serious.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a crime,” James Samba added quietly. “Give him a day.”</p>
<p>Munu shrugged. “Fine. One day. After that, you’re participating.”</p>
<p>Mukeh didn’t respond.</p>
<p>But he appreciated something about the interaction.</p>
<p>It wasn’t hostile.</p>
<p>It was testing.</p>
<p>And testing was familiar.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>He saw Francess later that week.</p>
<p>Not because someone introduced her.</p>
<p>Because the atmosphere shifted when she passed.</p>
<p>She wasn’t loud.</p>
<p>She wasn’t trying to be seen.</p>
<p>She didn’t command attention the way Munu did.</p>
<p>But attention followed her anyway.</p>
<p>She walked across the courtyard with measured steps, books held close, posture straight, expression composed.</p>
<p>Later he would learn she had topped her class consistently for years. No one had beaten her overall.</p>
<p>When someone managed to outscore her in a subject even briefly, she didn’t collapse.</p>
<p>She recalculated.</p>
<p>And reclaimed her place.</p>
<p>That wasn’t ego.</p>
<p>That was discipline.</p>
<p>Mukeh respected discipline.</p>
<p>He also felt something tighten inside him the first time he heard her answer a question in class.</p>
<p>Not jealousy.</p>
<p>Challenge.</p>
<p>He didn’t know her.</p>
<p>She didn’t know him.</p>
<p><strong>But awareness had begun.</strong></p>

  <h3>Chapter Two</h3>
  <h4>Under the Tree</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">By the second week, Mukeh understood something important:</p>
<p>The group under the big tree wasn’t random.</p>
<p>It was a system.</p>

<p>Lewis brought energy that refused to settle.<br>
Amidu brought ideas no one asked for but everyone argued.<br>
Dukes brought precision.<br>
Valentina brought ease.<br>
Hawa brought perception.<br>
Diallo brought quiet steadiness.<br>
James brought balance.<br>
Munu brought movement.<br>
And Yillah brought charm — the kind that made even silence look intentional.</p>

<p>Mukeh brought observation.</p>
<p>He still didn’t feel fully woven into the rhythm, but he wasn’t outside it either. He listened more than he spoke. Measured before responding. Watched how people reacted to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Especially her.</strong></p>

<p>Francess didn’t try to lead conversations. She didn’t need to. When she spoke, it was direct and structured. No filler. No wandering.</p>
<p>She never tried to be the smartest in the room.</p>
<p>She simply was.</p>
<p>And that unsettled him more than arrogance ever could.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>“Okay,” Munu said one afternoon, clapping his hands lightly. “We need to talk about this exam.”</p>
<p>Lewis groaned. “Already?”</p>
<p>“Yes, already,” Munu replied. “Some of you are acting like confidence is a study plan.”</p>
<p>Yillah leaned back against the tree trunk. “Confidence is part of it.”</p>
<p>“That’s because you flirt with teachers,” Dukes said flatly.</p>
<p>Yillah smiled lazily. “I don’t flirt. I connect.”</p>
<p>Valentina laughed.</p>
<p>Diallo shook her head softly but stayed close to Munu, her arm brushing his briefly.</p>
<p>Mukeh listened.</p>
<p>“New guy,” Munu said, turning toward him. “What’s your plan?”</p>
<p>Mukeh hesitated for half a second.</p>
<p>Then answered simply.</p>
<p>“Study consistently. Break topics down. Practice questions last.”</p>
<p>Lewis frowned. “That sounds like effort.”</p>
<p>“It is,” Mukeh replied.</p>
<p>Dukes nodded once. “That’s reasonable.”</p>
<p>Amidu leaned forward. “But effort doesn’t guarantee outcome.”</p>
<p>“No,” Mukeh said calmly. “But lack of effort guarantees failure.”</p>
<p>There was a brief pause.</p>
<p>Yillah tilted his head slightly, amused. “He talks like someone who’s been losing.”</p>
<p>Mukeh met his gaze evenly. “Or someone who doesn’t plan to.”</p>
<p>That earned a small reaction from Lewis.</p>
<p>Not loud approval.</p>
<p>Respect.</p>

<p>Across from them, Francess closed her notebook slowly.</p>
<p>“You’re over-structuring it,” she said.</p>
<p>Mukeh turned toward her. “Preparation is structure.”</p>
<p>“Structure without flexibility fails.”</p>
<p>Their eyes locked.</p>
<p>Not warm.</p>
<p>Not hostile.</p>
<p>Measured.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a debate yet.</p>
<p>It was a calibration.</p>

<p>Hawa watched closely.</p>
<p>Then she said it.</p>
<p>“Oh please. Everyone knows he’s working this hard because of Francess.”</p>

<p>The air changed.</p>
<p>Lewis froze mid-smirk.</p>
<p>Diallo’s eyes flicked toward Francess.</p>
<p>James looked at Mukeh immediately.</p>
<p>Munu didn’t laugh this time.</p>
<p>Yillah raised an eyebrow — not defensive, not tense — just entertained.</p>

<p>“That’s not—” Mukeh began.</p>
<p>“It’s not what?” Hawa asked softly.</p>
<p>She wasn’t teasing.</p>
<p>She was observing aloud.</p>

<p>Mukeh felt something tighten in his chest.</p>
<p>Was he working harder because Francess existed?</p>
<p>Not to impress her.</p>
<p>But because she was the standard.</p>
<p>And he refused to stand beneath a standard.</p>

<p>Francess spoke calmly.</p>
<p>“If someone chooses to work hard, that’s their decision.”</p>
<p>Neutral.</p>
<p>Composed.</p>
<p>But distant.</p>

<p>That distance mattered.</p>
<p>Mukeh held her gaze for a fraction too long.</p>
<p>There was no softness there.</p>
<p>No denial.</p>
<p>Just awareness.</p>
<p>Challenge.</p>

<p>Yillah broke the tension casually.</p>
<p>“So what I’m hearing,” he said lightly, “is we should all start working harder.”</p>
<p>Lewis groaned. “Not you too.”</p>
<p>Valentina laughed, and the moment loosened slightly.</p>
<p>Conversation resumed.</p>
<p>But something had shifted.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>As the group began to disperse, Yillah fell into step beside Mukeh.</p>
<p>Not confrontational.</p>
<p>Not protective.</p>
<p>Just smooth.</p>
<p>“You competitive?” Yillah asked casually.</p>
<p>“With myself,” Mukeh replied.</p>
<p>Yillah smiled faintly. “Good answer.”</p>
<p>A beat passed.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>“Just don’t let people narrate your story for you.”</p>
<p>Mukeh glanced at him.</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
<p>Yillah nodded once and drifted back toward the others, already mid-conversation with Valentina about something unrelated.</p>

<p>Diallo called Munu’s name softly.</p>
<p>He turned immediately, expression easing without effort.</p>
<p>They walked off together — not loudly, not dramatically — just naturally aligned.</p>

<p>James lingered behind for a moment.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to prove anything,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>Mukeh didn’t respond right away.</p>
<p>“I know,” he said finally.</p>
<p>But he wasn’t sure that was true.</p>

<p>Across the courtyard, Francess packed her things with controlled movements.</p>
<p>Hawa leaned slightly toward her.</p>
<p>“You don’t like that he’s trying to match you,” Hawa said.</p>
<p>Francess didn’t look up.</p>
<p>“I don’t like being someone’s reason.”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t look like he’s chasing.”</p>
<p>“No,” Francess agreed softly. “He looks like he’s measuring.”</p>

<p>That unsettled her more.</p>
<p>Because being measured meant being seen.</p>
<p>And being seen meant vulnerability.</p>
<p>She didn’t do vulnerability.</p>
<p>Not publicly.</p>

<p>That evening, Mukeh studied again.</p>
<p>Not angrily.</p>
<p>Not obsessively.</p>
<p>Intentionally.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to beat Francess.</p>
<p>He wanted to stand beside her.</p>
<p>And that required strength.</p>

<p>Across town, Francess reviewed her notes.</p>
<p>Not thinking about him.</p>
<p>But aware of him.</p>
<p>And awareness is where everything begins.</p>

  <h3>Chapter Three</h3>
  <h4>Calibration</h4>
</section>

<p class="dropcap">The tension from under the tree didn’t dissolve.</p>
<p>It adjusted.</p>

<p>By midweek, the group found themselves near the basketball court again. It wasn’t planned. It rarely was. Lewis brought the ball. Munu brought commentary. Yillah brought smooth distractions. Valentina brought movement in and out of conversations like she was conducting something invisible.</p>

<p>Diallo stood near Munu, quieter in the open space, her presence noticeable mostly by proximity. She wasn’t loud enough to dominate, but not withdrawn enough to disappear.</p>

<p>James leaned against the fence, watching without intruding.</p>

<p>Mukeh stood inside the circle this time.</p>
<p>Not fully merged.</p>
<p>But not outside either.</p>

<p>Lewis spun the ball once in his hand.</p>
<p>“New guy,” he said. “Let’s see if intelligence translates.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t mocking.</p>
<p>It was invitation.</p>

<p>Munu added, “You’ve been talking discipline all week. Show balance.”</p>

<p>Mukeh didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>He stepped onto the court.</p>
<p>The first shot missed.</p>
<p>Lewis raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>The second attempt hit the rim.</p>
<p>Munu didn’t laugh. He just folded his arms, watching.</p>
<p>The third went in clean.</p>
<p>Lewis nodded once. “Adjustment.”</p>
<p>That word mattered.</p>

<p>Mukeh didn’t smile.</p>
<p>He didn’t celebrate.</p>
<p>He stepped back into the group like it was expected.</p>

<p>Across from him, Francess watched.</p>
<p>Not impressed.</p>
<p>Not dismissive.</p>
<p>Just observing.</p>
<p>That observation felt heavier than approval.</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>The game lost intensity after a while. Conversations reformed naturally.</p>
<p>Amidu restarted a philosophical argument.<br>
Dukes dismantled it calmly.<br>
Valentina laughed at something Yillah said.<br>
Munu engaged three people at once without trying.</p>

<p>Mukeh felt it — the rhythm of belonging beginning to take shape.</p>
<p>Not because he was loud.</p>
<p>But because he wasn’t invisible.</p>

<p>He caught Francess’ eye once.</p>
<p>It wasn’t accidental.</p>
<p>It wasn’t intentional either.</p>
<p>Just awareness.</p>

<p>He walked toward her.</p>
<p>Not fast.</p>
<p>Not hesitant.</p>
<p>Measured.</p>

<p>“Are you staying?” he asked.</p>
<p>“For what?” she replied evenly.</p>
<p>“Study session.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need supervision.”</p>
<p>“I’m not asking for supervision.”</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
<p>“Then what are you asking for?”</p>

<p>There were multiple correct answers.</p>
<p>He chose none of them.</p>

<p>“Company.”</p>

<p>The word didn’t land softly.</p>
<p>It didn’t land strategically.</p>
<p>It just sat there.</p>
<p>Unlabeled.</p>

<p>Hawa noticed the exchange immediately.</p>
<p>Yillah glanced over briefly but didn’t interfere.</p>
<p>James shifted slightly, attentive but not intrusive.</p>

<p>Francess held Mukeh’s gaze.</p>
<p>There was no warmth in it.</p>
<p>No irritation either.</p>
<p>She was reading him.</p>
<p>And he was letting her.</p>

<p>“I have an hour,” she said finally.</p>
<p>It wasn’t agreement.</p>
<p>It wasn’t refusal.</p>
<p>It was controlled allowance.</p>

<p>Mukeh nodded once.</p>
<p>Nothing more.</p>

<p>They walked toward the library steps with space between them — not close enough to suggest anything, not far enough to deny awareness.</p>

<p>Behind them, Munu watched for half a second before turning back to Lewis.</p>
<p>“See?” he said lightly. “Inclusion.”</p>

<p>Diallo tapped his arm softly.</p>
<p>“Let them breathe,” she murmured.</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>“Always.”</p>

<div class="scene-break">✦</div>

<p>On the library steps, the air felt different.</p>
<p>Quieter.</p>
<p>Less performative.</p>

<p>They sat with deliberate distance.</p>
<p>Books opened.</p>
<p>Pens moved.</p>
<p>Silence stretched.</p>

<p>“You skipped a step,” Francess said after a few minutes.</p>
<p>“I condensed it.”</p>
<p>“You assumed understanding.”</p>
<p>“I trusted logic.”</p>

<p>She looked at him.</p>
<p>“That’s not the same thing.”</p>

<p>“And over-explaining isn’t strength.”</p>

<p>The exchange wasn’t heated.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t relaxed either.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to compete with me,” she said calmly.</p>
<p>“I’m not competing.”</p>
<p>“You are.”</p>
<p>“And what are you doing?”</p>

<p>That pause again.</p>
<p>Measured.</p>

<p>She didn’t answer immediately.</p>

<p>“When you’re the one who doesn’t slip,” she said quietly, “you don’t get the luxury of uncertainty.”</p>

<p>He studied her expression.</p>
<p>It wasn’t vulnerability.</p>
<p>It was control under pressure.</p>

<p>“For you, correcting might feel like pride,” she continued. “For me, it’s survival.”</p>

<p>The word hung heavier than expected.</p>

<p>Neither softened.</p>
<p>Neither retreated.</p>

<p>But something shifted.</p>
<p>Not into closeness.</p>
<p>Into recognition.</p>

<p>After a moment, she closed her notebook.</p>
<p>“We still have twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>And they returned to work.</p>
<p>Ambiguous.</p>
<p>Unreadable.</p>
<p>Unresolved.</p>
